        "#Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data (attributes) and\n",
        "code (methods).It focuses on organizing software into reusable, modular pieces instead of writing code in a linear (procedural) way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template that defines how to create objects.\n",
        "It describes the attributes (data/properties) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world entity or an instance of a class.\n",
        "It represents something that has state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+\n",
        "\n",
        "->Abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that deal with hiding information, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is a design-level concept that focuses on the \"what.\" It's about providing a clear, simple interface to the user or another part of the program, hiding the complex inner workings behind it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, this is achieved through concepts like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes and interfaces: These define a blueprint of what a class should do (the methods it should have), but they don't provide the complete implementation. Subclasses must then implement the details.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Hiding implementation details: A function like print() is an abstraction. You know what it does (it prints text to the console), but you don't need to know the intricate code that makes it happen within the operating system or hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is an implementation-level concept that focuses on the \"how.\" It's the practice of bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It then restricts direct access to the data from outside the class. This is also known as data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, this is achieved by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bundling data and methods: Creating a class that contains its own variables and the functions that manipulate those variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using access modifiers: Using keywords like private, protected, and public to control which parts of the program can access the data and methods. A common practice is to make data members private and provide public \"getter\" and \"setter\" methods to read and modify them. This ensures data integrity by preventing other parts of the program from directly and incorrectly changing the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "->Dunder methods, also known as special methods or magic methods, are built-in methods in Python that have names starting and ending with two underscores, like __init__ or __str__.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the Concept of Inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (the parent or superclass). This creates a \"is-a\" relationship, meaning the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "# Parent class\n",
        "class Mammal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.has_fur = True\n",
        "\n",
        "    def breathe(self):\n",
        "        print(\"I am breathing air.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Child class inheriting from Mammal\n",
        "class Dog(Mammal):\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        # Call the parent's constructor\n",
        "        super().__init__()\n",
        "        self.breed = \"Golden Retriever\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        " # Create a Dog object\n",
        "my_dog = Dog()\n",
        "\n",
        "print(f\"Does my dog have fur? {my_dog.has_fur}\")  # Inherited attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dog.breathe() # Inherited method\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dog.bark()    # Own method\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is Polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism, one of the three pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a parent class called Animal with a method make_sound(). . You can then create different child classes like Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal. Both Dog and Cat can have their own unique make_sound() method:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Dog class's make_sound() would print \"Woof!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cat class's make_sound() would print \"Meow!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is Encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using name mangling to make attributes \"private,\" which is a convention rather than a strict enforcement. While other languages use access modifiers like public, private, and protected, Python does not have true private access. Instead, it relies on a combination of convention and a language feature that discourages direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self._internal_data = 100 # Convention for a \"private\" attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_data(self):\n",
        "        return self._internal_data\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = MyClass()\n",
        "\n",
        "print(obj._internal_data) # This works, but is considered bad practice\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize an object's state when it's created. It's automatically called right after the object is instantiated from a class. The most common constructor method in Python is __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    # This is the constructor\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make      # Initializing attributes\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "        self.is_running = False # A default attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating a new Car object\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing the initialized attributes\n",
        "print(f\"My car is a {my_car.make} {my_car.model} from {my_car.year}.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are Class and Static Methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Class and static methods in Python are two types of methods that are bound to the class itself rather than to an instance of the class. The main difference lies in their purpose and how they access information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method is a method that receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls. It's defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following example, from_string is a class method that takes a string and returns a new Person object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def from_string(cls, person_string):\n",
        "        name, age = person_string.split('-')\n",
        "        return cls(name, int(age)) # cls() creates an instance of the class\n",
        "\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "person2 = Person.from_string(\"Bob-25\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(person2.name) # Output: Bob\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "A static method is a method that belongs to a class but does not have access to either the class itself or an instance of the class. It's defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, is_adult is a static method. It takes an age and returns a boolean, and it doesn't need access to the Person class or any Person object's data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def is_adult(age):\n",
        "        return age >= 18\n",
        "\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Charlie\", 20)\n",
        "is_charlie_adult = Person.is_adult(person1.age)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(is_charlie_adult) # Output: True\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "->Definition\n",
        "Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (like in Java/C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support true method overloading because:\n",
        "\n",
        "The latest defined method with the same name will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Python Handles It\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of true overloading, Python uses:\n",
        "1. Default arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variable-length arguments ( *args , **kwargs )\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, a single method can handle different numbers of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example1: Default Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        " class Calculator:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def add(self, a=0, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        " calc = Calculator()\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(2))        # 2\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(2, 3))     # 5\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(2, 3, 4))  #\n",
        "\n",
        "Example2: Variable-Length Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        " class Calculator:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def add(self, *args):\n",
        "\n",
        "        return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        " calc = Calculator()\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(5))               #\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(2, 3, 4))         # 9\n",
        "\n",
        " print(calc.add(10, 20, 30, 40))  # 100\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is Method Overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method overriding is an OOP concept where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.The new method in the subclass has the exact same name, number of parameters, and return type as the one in the superclass. This allows a subclass to customize or specialize the behavior it inherits from its parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a family. A child might inherit a habit from a parent, like \"cooking dinner.\" However, the child's way of cooking dinner might be completely different from the parent's. In OOP, the cook_dinner() method is inherited, but the child class can override it with its own unique implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",

        "    # This method overrides the speak() method from the parent class\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    # This method also overrides the speak() method\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create instances of the classes\n",
        "generic_animal = Animal()\n",
        "my_dog = Dog()\n",
        "my_cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the speak() method on each object\n",
        "generic_animal.speak() # Output: I am an animal.\n",
        "my_dog.speak()         # Output: Woof!\n",
        "my_cat.speak()         # Output: Meow!\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a Property Decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->A property decorator in Python is a way to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for a class attribute using a clean and concise syntax. It allows us to control how an attribute is accessed, modified, and deleted without changing the way the attribute is called from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Using @property\n",
        " class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name   # private variable convention\n",

        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name   # getter\n",
        "    @name.setter\n",
        "    def name(self, value):\n",
        "        if not value.strip():     # validation\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Name cannot be empty!\")\n",
        "        self._name = value        # setter\n",
        "    @name.deleter\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Deleting name...\")\n",
        "        del self._name\n",
        " # Test\n",
        " s = Student(\"Ritesh\")\n",
        " print(s.name)   # Access like attribute → Ritesh\n",
        " s.name = \"Aditi\"   # Calls setter internally\n",
        " print(s.name)      # Aditi\n",
        " del s.name         # Calls delete\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is Polymorphism Important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it promotes flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in code. It allows us to write more generic and abstract code that can work with a variety of objects, simplifying complex systems and making them easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A function get_sound(animal) can work with any object that inherits from Animal and has a make_sound() method.\n",
        "\n",

        "get_sound(my_cat) # Calls Cat's make_sound()\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an Abstract Class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface and a set of methods that its subclasses must implement.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a structured way of writing code by organizing it around objects and classes.\n",
        " It offers several advantages over traditional procedural programming.\n",
        " Advantages of OOP\n",
        " 1. Modularity (Code Reusability)\n",
        " Code is divided into classes and objects, making it modular and reusable.\n",
        " Once a class is created, it can be reused in different programs.\n",
        " 2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)\n",
        " Sensitive data can be hidden inside a class and accessed only through defined methods.\n",
        " This improves security and prevents misuse.\n",
        " 3. Inheritance\n",
        " Classes can reuse and extend functionality from other classes.\n",
        " Promotes code reusability and avoids duplication.\n",
        " 4. Polymorphism\n",
        " The same function or method can work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
        " Makes the code more flexible and maintainable.\n",
        " 5. Abstraction\n",
        " Only essential details are shown, while complex implementation is hidden.\n",
        " Helps in reducing complexity.\n",
        " 6. Maintainability\n",
        " OOP code is easier to update, modify, and maintain because each class is independent.\n",
        " 7. Scalability\n",
        " Large projects can be managed efficiently as OOP makes it easier to divide work into modules (classes)\n",
